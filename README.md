## üõ† Building From Sources

### üìÉ Requirements

- **Java 21 JDK**
  - I recommend using the [Azul Zulu](https://www.azul.com) distribution as it is what I use to build the mod but, this isn't strictly required. You should be able to use whichever JDK distribution you want without issues.
- **A Google Cloud Project**
  - In order to be able to access and use the Google Drive, you'll need a Google Cloud project. You can follow [this guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/quickstart/java) to create one.


Like most Minecraft mods, Worldback Machine uses the standard Gradle project structure and can be compiled by simply running the default `build` task. After running the task, the build artifacts can be found in the `build/libs` directory.

In order to run the game from within your IDE, you'll need two more things: A Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID and a dotenv file.

Firstly, in the `resources` directory, create a file called `.env`. Then copy and paste the following:
```text
# The location of the 'credentials.json' file starting from the 'resources' directory.
CREDENTIALS_FILE=
```

Set the 'CREDENTIALS_FILE' to whatever you want. You can then follow the [Google Drive API Java Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/quickstart/java) to a OAuth Client ID. Once you have it, put it to the location you have set in the 'CREDENTIALS_FILE' variable.
